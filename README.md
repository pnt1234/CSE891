### Course Description: 
This introductory course is intended to provide the background needed for students interested to enroll in graduate-level courses such as CSE 802, CSE 881, CSE 847, and CSE 891 (deep learning). The course does not require students to have any prior background in data science related area and will cover the mathematical foundations in linear algebra, probability theory, and statistics, as well as the fundamental concepts in data science. There are no formal textbooks for this class, though the lecture materials are mostly adapted from the following books:
- A. Blum, J. Hopcroft, and R. Kannan. “Foundations of Data Science”, Cambridge University Press (2020, forthcoming). A draft of the book is available [here](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/jeh/book.pdf).
- S. Banerjee and A. Roy. “Linear Algebra and Matrix Analysis for Statistics”, CRC Press (2014).

### Course Outline: 
The topics to be covered in this course include:
- Review of linear algebra, probability, and statistics
- Gradient descent and basics of numerical optimization methods
- High dimensional space and random projection
- Feature learning and subspaces
- Random walk and Markov chain Monte Carlo
- Linear models, kernel methods, and deep learning
- Cluster analysis
- Algorithms for Massive Data (streaming, sketching, and sampling)

### Course Assessment:
Students will be accessed based on the following:
- Homework exercises (60%)
- Exams (20%)
- Mini-projects (20%)

All programming assignments in homework and mini-projects must be implemented in Python. The final grade will be determined based on the following scale:

| GPA |   Grade  |
|-----|:---------|
| 4.0 | [90,100] |
| 3.5 | [85,90)  |
| 3.0 | [80,85)  |
| 2.5 | [75,80)  |
| 2.0 | [70,75)  |
| 1.5 | [65,70)  |
| 1.0 | [60,65)  |
