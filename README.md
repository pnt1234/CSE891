The materials for the course will be adapted from the following textbook:
- C.C. Aggarwal, "Linear Algebra and Optimization for Machine Learning: A Textbook". Springer (2020). 

Lecture materials will also be taken from the following recommended books: 
- A. Blum, J. Hopcroft, and R. Kannan. “Foundations of Data Science”, Cambridge University Press (2020). A draft of the book is available [here](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/jeh/book.pdf).
- S. Banerjee and A. Roy. “Linear Algebra and Matrix Analysis for Statistics”, CRC Press (2014).
- S. Boyd and L. Vandenberghe, "Introduction to Applied Linear Algebra – Vectors, Matrices, and Least Squares", Cambridge University Press (2018). A draft of the book is available [here](http://vmls-book.stanford.edu/).

The last day to add this course is the end of the first week of classes. The last day to drop this course with a 100 percent refund and no grade reported is Sept 28, 2020. The details about the academic calendar can be found at [https://reg.msu.edu/ROInfo/Calendar/Academic.aspx](https://reg.msu.edu/ROInfo/Calendar/Academic.aspx).

### Course Policies:

- **Attendance and Participation:** Although the lectures are recorded, students are expected to attend the online lectures synchronously and must inform the instructor if they are unable to do so due to emergency or other legitimate reasons. Students are expected to participate in all online activities for the course as listed on the course syllabus and calendar. The instructor will monitor student participation in the class using D2L and zoom tracking tools to assess their level of participation.
- **Online Quizzes:** Online quizzes will be available on D2L and must be completed before midnight on Friday of the assigned week. No extension will be given. 
- **Assignment and Late Submission Policy:** Homework assignments are due before midnight on the due date unless specified otherwise.  You must use [D2L](http://d2l.msu.edu) to submit a soft copy of your solution. Late assignments will be penalized 25% of the total possible assignment grade (if submitted the next day after the deadline) or 50% (if submitted the second day after the deadline). Assignments submitted later than that will not be accepted.
- **Exam Information:** An online exam will be given during the semester. The exam will be open book and notes. Students must make arrangements to take the exam via zoom. You need to have a second camera available (e.g., from your phone) to display your computer screen during the exam. Make-up examination can be arranged if your absence is due to conference travel, documented illness, personal emergency, or if your location prohibits doing the exam in synchronous mode. A written explanation (including supporting documentation) must be submitted to the instructor; if the explanation is acceptable, an alternative to the examination will be arranged. Except for emergency cases, make-up arrangements must be made in advance, at least a week before the scheduled exam. 
- **Discussion Forum:** We will be using [Piazza](https://piazza.com/msu/fall2020/cse891/home) for class discussion. Rather than emailing class-related questions to the instructor, you are encouraged to post them on Piazza. Do not post your solution or attempted solution (e.g., for assignments or project) on Piazza. 
- **Study Groups:** You are allowed to form study groups to learn the materials in class. However, you are forbidden from sharing the solution of your quizzes, homework assignments, and programming project with other students. All submitted assignments (quizzes, homeworks, project, and exam) must be your own work. Students who were found copying or sharing their solutions with other students will automatically receive a zero for the entire assignment. In addition, an Academic Dishonesty Report will be filed and submitted to the university.
- **Resources for Persons with Disabilities (RCPD):** Michigan State University is committed to providing equal opportunity for participation in all programs, services and activities. Requests for accommodations by persons with disabilities may be made by contacting the Resource Center for Persons with Disabilities at 517-884-RCPD or on the web at rcpd.msu.edu. Once your eligibility for an accommodation has been determined, you will be issued a verified individual services accommodation (“VISA”) form. Please present this form to me at the start of the term and/or two weeks prior to the accommodation date (exam, homework, project, etc). To make an appointment with a specialist, contact:  (517) 353-9642 or TTY:  (517) 355-1293. The website for RCPD is located at [http://MYProfile.rcpd.msu.edu](http://MYProfile.rcpd.msu.edu).
- **Academic Honesty:** All students are expected to be responsible users of the computer system provided by the Department of Computer Science and Engineering and College of Engineering. The Department of Computer Science adheres to the policies on academic honesty as specified in General Student Regulations 1.0, Protection of Scholarship and Grades, and in the all-University Policy on Integrity of Scholarship and Grades, which are included in Spartan Life; Student Handbook and Resource Guide. Students who plagiarize will receive a 0.0 on the assignment/exam/project/quiz.  
- **Religious Observance:** Michigan State University has long had a policy to permit students, faculty/academic staff, and support staff to observe those holidays set aside by their chosen religious faith If you wish to be absent from class to observe a religious holiday, make arrangements in advance with the instructor.
- **Tolerance and Civility** MSU strives to build an academic community with living and learning environments that expects tolerance of viewpoints and civility toward others, whether at public forums, athletic events, in residential communities, classrooms or laboratories. We call upon all who participate in university events to promote tolerance and civil behavior and to hold themselves to high standards that reflect the university’s commitment to respect viewpoints that may be different from their own. Only by respecting individuals with diverse perspectives and ideas can we build an environment of civility that is conducive to advancing knowledge and transforming lives.
