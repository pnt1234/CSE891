### Course Description: 
This introductory course is intended to provide the background needed for students interested to enroll in graduate-level courses such as CSE 802, CSE 881, CSE 847, and CSE 891 (deep learning). The course does not require students to have any prior background in data science related areas and will cover mathematical foundations in linear algebra, probability theory, and statistics, as well as some fundamental concepts in data science. The materials for the course will be adapted from the following textbook:
- C.C. Aggarwal, "Linear Algebra and Optimization for Machine Learning: A Textbook". Springer (2020). 

Lecture materials will also be taken from the following recommended books: 
- A. Blum, J. Hopcroft, and R. Kannan. “Foundations of Data Science”, Cambridge University Press (2020). A draft of the book is available [here](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/jeh/book.pdf).
- S. Banerjee and A. Roy. “Linear Algebra and Matrix Analysis for Statistics”, CRC Press (2014).
- S. Boyd and L. Vandenberghe, "Introduction to Applied Linear Algebra – Vectors, Matrices, and Least Squares", Cambridge University Press (2018). A draft of the book is available [here](http://vmls-book.stanford.edu/).

### Course Requirements:
-	Internet connection (DSL, LAN, or cable connection desirable)
-	Access to [Desire2Learn](https://d2l.msu.edu) (D2L) and [Piazza](https://piazza.com/msu/fall2020/cse891/home). 
-	Ability to scan and upload documents.
-	Laptop or desktop computer with capabilities to write and execute python programs. 

### Course Delivery:
This course will be delivered through online (synchronous) instruction. You will need your MSU NetID to login to the course content on the D2L homepage (http://d2l.msu.edu). In D2L, you will access the course materials, quizzes, assignments, and additional resources. Zoom links for online lecture and office hours are also posted on D2L. [Piazza](https://piazza.com/msu/fall2020/cse891/home) will be used as the discussion forum for students to ask questions. 

### D2L Technical Assistance

### Class Recordings  
Each lecture session of this course will be recorded. The recordings will be available to students registered for this class. This is intended to supplement the classroom experience. Students  are  expected to follow appropriate University policies and maintain the security of passwords used to access recorded lectures. Recordings may not be  reproduced, shared with those not in the class, or uploaded to other online environments. Doing so may result in disciplinary action. 

### Course Outline: 
The topics to be covered in this course include:
- Linear algebra (chapters 1-3, 7, 8 of Aggarwal2020)
- Probability and statistics.
- Numerical optimization (chapters 4-6 of Aggarwal2020).
- Random walk and Markov chain Monte Carlo (chapter 4 of Blum et al 2020).
- Generalization from data (chapter 2 and 5 of Blum et al 2020).

### Course Assessment:
Students will be assessed based on the following:
- Homework (60%)
- Online quizzes (20%)
- Mini-project (10%)
- Exam (10%)

The final grade will be determined based on the following scale:

| GPA |   Grade  |
|-----|:---------|
| 4.0 | [90,100] |
| 3.5 | [85,90)  |
| 3.0 | [80,85)  |
| 2.5 | [75,80)  |
| 2.0 | [70,75)  |
| 1.5 | [65,70)  |
| 1.0 | [60,65)  |

### Important Dates:
- Online open add period ends: Wed, Sept 9, 2020
- Last date to drop a course with full refund: Mon, Sept 28, 2019

### Course Policy:

- Students are expected to attend the online lectures and must inform the instructor if they are unable to attend due to emergency or other acceptable reasons (e.g., difference in time zone due to out of country location). 
- Homework assignments are due before midnight on the due date unless specified otherwise.  You must use [D2L](http://d2l.msu.edu) to submit a soft copy of your solution. Late assignments will be penalized 25% of the total possible assignment grade (if submitted the next day after the deadline) or 50% (if submitted the second day after the deadline). Assignments submitted later than that will not be accepted.
- Online quizzes will be available on D2L and must be completed before midnight on Friday of the assigned week. No extension will be given.  
- An online exam will be given during the semester. The exam will be open book and notes. Students must make arrangements to take the exam via zoom. You need to have a second camera available (e.g., from your phone) to display your computer screen during the exam. Make-up examination can be arranged if your absence is due to conference travel, documented illness, personal emergency, or if your location prohibits doing the exam in synchronous mode. A written explanation (including supporting documentation) must be submitted to the instructor; if the explanation is acceptable, an alternative to the examination will be arranged. Except for emergency cases, make-up arrangements must be made in advance, at least a week before the scheduled exam. 
- We will be using [Piazza](https://piazza.com/msu/fall2020/cse891/home) for class discussion. Rather than emailing class-related questions to the instructor, you are encouraged to post them on Piazza. Do not post your solution or attempted solution (e.g., for assignments or project) on Piazza. 
- You are allowed to form study groups to learn the materials in class. However, you are forbidden from sharing the solution of your quizzes, homework assignments, and programming project with other students. All submitted assignments (quizzes, homeworks, project, and exam) must be your own work. Students who were found copying or sharing their solutions with other students will automatically receive a zero for the entire assignment. In addition, an Academic Dishonesty Report will be filed and submitted to the university.
- All students are expected to be responsible users of the computer system provided by the Department of Computer Science and Engineering and College of Engineering. The Department of Computer Science expects all students to adhere to MSU’s policy on Academic Honesty and Integrity. Information about the policy is available at https://www.msu.edu/~ombud/academic-integrity/index.html.
